 This is cassette two, side one, continuation with Mabel Dawson Borg in Des Moines, Iowa. Cassette two, side one. So they went to Denmark for the hospital. Yes, and when they were in church on Sunday, who should sit in the back row with them but Victor Borge. And of course, they came and got him out because he was a VIP, so they had to move him up closer. But anyway, it was interesting. Judy in Albuquerque is very much interested in the Swedish background and she has started corresponding with some of the cousins in Sweden. And I've put in touch with them. What kind of questions do they ask you now, for instance, about the Sweden? Because you've been there so many times. Do they ask anything in particular? Well, I think I talk more than wait for questions. I think I know what they want to know and I tell them about our schools. But we've been together now so many times, we've come to know each other so very well. And the one, Anna, my cousin now, looks so much like my mother. And to think there's an ocean between us and yet she looks exactly like my mother. So when you went back, your parents were already dead then? Yes. My mother said, I will never cross that ocean again. And the airplanes weren't flying as extensively in 1948, you see. And so I know that if it had been today, they would have been back there. So this scared her off then? That's right. Oh, she never forgot how sick she was. So it was a bad experience. It was, yeah. It was the end of her life. And but she probably told you about the things on her birthplace and farm. Oh, and of course, Dad, he envied Mother because of their home life, you see, and what they had. And the thing that interested me was that there were some people on the farm that lived there and they were very, very good friends of my grandmother and grandfather. And my mother said they often went to visit there. And then when we came to Sweden, I came there in 52, and every time I brought gifts for all of them, you know. And then we've always had a dinner at the hotel for all of them, everything, the works. And so we always had Christine and Carl with us. And I thought, just think how envious Papa would have been to know that they were my good friends. And she made me a shawl. And you know, people with means, yeah. So what kind of gifts did you bring them? Did they ask for anything? No, no, they don't ask for anything. We brought them slips. And we took them from size 8 to 52. And then we brought them men's sleeps, you know. And then we brought handkerchiefs and, but, and holes. This was before holes were so easy to get. And then of course, Mama always used to send coffee and rice to them during the, yes, uh-huh. Yeah, yeah. So but you also had the meeting and the going to Sweden in 1952. How did they come about that? You were elected of two people in Iowa, you were one of them. Yes. Well, our international, our national president, she became international later, said, Mabel, you have to go with me. I'm going to Stockholm and I don't know the language. I said, you don't need to know the language. They all speak English. But she talked me into it. And there was the international, what kind of women? Business and professional women. Yrkeskvinnas. Yrkeskvinnas. Yeah. And so we went for that. And I got in on all the things, you see, because that's when we were 1,400 at dinner at the city hall. And I can see those men yet with their big trays coming down the steps, you know, nobody stumbled or fell. And Queen Louise was hostess and in charge. And well, we got to know each other. And then we went into homes. And Magda Buhl, have you ever heard of her making the dolls? Well, I corresponded with her for years. However, now she's married and we've kind of lost track of each other. But I have one of her dolls that she made and we were in her home one night, about 20 of us. One was from Italy and one was from, and Marc Uri. And I've been corresponding with a lot of them since we were there. And because Helen was national president, I was always taking Polaroid pictures, you know. And I do remember this one time we were at the church in St. Ausre. And that church is open only twice a year. That's the old one built in 700. That's right. 1100. That's right. 1100. And then we went into the church there and I'd heard, you see, Mama's folks sat on the first floor. Dad's folks sat in the balcony. And so Dad would tell me about the murals on the wall, which were so beautiful. And he'd tell about the one with the lady, the devil with his fork in the lady's back. That's the way he described it. And so I said to the minister, I'm going to lie down on this bench and take a picture of that. And I did. And I brought that back home with me. And in my talks, I've shown that too, you know. And of course, with the floors. And then of course, they didn't trust anybody. They kept the money bag on the handle so they passed that in. But the same pictures, you know, in that church and the beautiful, well, the floor, of course, was a stone floor and no heating and the walls three feet thick. And but. They were all the same as when your mother went to church. Exactly. And even the altar rail. Not a bit. But the altar rail and live under use, you know, the living camp. Do you think a tradition like that is good for people to have stages like that? I do. Yes, I do. And for posterity. And that should encourage young people to be proud of their posterity. So they should be aware of changing too much. That's right. They shouldn't change at all. Well, of course, then they had the new church in 1906. Yes, but they haven't changed too much either. I know it. I know it. And it's beautiful. And for what they built in 1906. But that's a new church. So your mother didn't know anything about that one? No, no. So she went to the old one. That's right. Fädenna kyrka. Yeah, right. And you had no trouble to understand the sermon when the pastor. Not a bit, because I had I went to church every Sunday when we had the Swedish services, you see. And when I came to Stockholm the first time, I took a cab to go to Birger Lindqvist. And this is the father of Jean Lindqvist. That's the father. That's one of his pictures that I have out there in the hall. An original. And so when I got in the taxi to go out to Karl Lindqvist, he said, near Tobacco. I said, I've never been here. Only Torres of Brasovinska. Yeah, that's it. I learned as a child. And you were also on Sveriges Radio? That's right, yeah. Samuelsson, or what was the name of the person who interviewed you? Frequent Samuelsson. Frequent Samuelsson. And there was no difficulty in understanding what they said? No. I spoke for half an hour about my work here. But there aren't many Swedes here in Des Moines that you can talk to every day. How do you remember all this now? Well, I was a little bit. I was a little bit. I was a little bit. I was a little bit. I was a little bit. I was a little bit. I was a little bit. I was a little bit.

I was a little bit. I was a little bit. I was a little bit. I was a little bit. I was a little bit. I was a little bit. I did. Mama Swedish got awfully rut-värska. And dad did pretty well in English. Mama did good enough, you know, but she didn't study that hard. She could have. But oh, did she know the literature, and did she know, and she read to dad all through that year that he was so ill. He loved to have her read to him because she did it beautifully. In Swedish? In Swedish. And she wrote poetry in Swedish. Whenever the ladies, little ladies, would have the coffee parties, birthdays, she would always write a Swedish poem for them, yeah, beautiful. 100th anniversary for the church. In your church? Yes. Well, we had a program, a Swedish program, and they had me come and read the Swedish things, you know. And I had to give a health sedentary hymn, you know, to Blott and Dag, and to Grymblycki Sender, and those that came into the program. So did you notice that over the years when the people got older, the Swedes, they wanted to hear something spoken in Swedish? Yes, they did. Some poem or verse? They did. And they would revert to the Swedish in their speech. Yes, I should say, and I've translated that so many times phonetically for people who don't know Swedish, you know. They want to know it is. Yeah. More secure as no one ever than the children of the father, yeah. Yeah.
