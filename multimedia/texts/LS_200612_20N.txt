 I'm sitting together with Hulda Anderson in Rockford, Illinois. She was born 1897, 4th of June in Bell River, Minnesota. And we have February 4th, 1987. So, your parents, they both came from Sweden? Yes, they did. Father and mother? Sure. And mother, she came from Flobby? Yeah, Flobby, that's right. Oh, and she came as a young girl over here. Do you know where that was? Yeah, I know the place. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Do you know the reason why your mother came over, for instance? Yes, there was a family by the name of Brantz. They were related to us, and they were coming to Sweden, and they wanted to take my mother with. So, my mother, the grandma let her go, see? So, she was quite young when she came here. Settled down in the woods. And were there many boys and girls in that family? Sisters and brothers? No, just a sister and a brother. Two brothers, but one of them went to America and then got never heard from him after that. And your mother, now, how old was she then? 16, you said? She was 19 when she came. 19? Uh-huh. And she knew very little about the United States. She didn't know anything. Couldn't talk or anything. And this family, Brantz now, Brantz family, were they living in Minnesota at that time? No, they come from Sweden. That's the one mother came with. I see. So, they haven't been in the United States then when they came to your mother? No, they just came. They were new, too. Yeah, they were new. But they set out for Minnesota? Uh-huh. And they came to what place up there? Spruce City, by Rose City. Rose City? Rose City. It's a little creamery and a store and a few houses there. That's about all. Were they coming to relation then or why did they set out there? No, they just came and... Took up a homestead? Took up a homestead, yeah. That's right. Uh-huh. Mother and father did, too. They took up a homestead. They had to cut the logs down to build a little log hut. They only had a dirt floor. And no... just log walls inside. Very dark and gloomy, she said. Yeah. So, if we start... continue with your mother, then how long did she stay there with this Brent family? She went to Alexandria to work and she worked in a hotel there. She didn't work for the family then, the Brents? No, no, no. She went to Alexandria? She went to Alexandria and got a job in a hotel doing the washing. She washed clothes by hand. And she got a dollar a week. And board? Yeah. Dollar a week and something to eat. Wasn't much. How long did she continue with that? About a year, I guess it was. And then she met your father? Then they got married. She knew her father. She knew the father. She knew my father before. From Sweden? On the boat they got acquainted. So he was working too in Alexandria. But I don't know what he did. I don't remember what he did. When they met on the boat now? Yeah, they met on the boat. Was his intention to go to Minnesota also? Oh, yes. Sure, sure. So he didn't settle in Alexandria just because of his father? Yes. Well, the Brent family... It was a drawing card? Yeah. The Brent family settled there and they just followed along from New York. From New York? Mm-hmm. Did they talk much about Sweden, your parents? Yeah. My mother told her how hardship it was. They were very poor. Mother went out and she only had seven days of school. Seven days? Seven days of school. But she was 19 then when she came? Yeah, when she came. But that was when she was a young girl in Sweden. She only had seven days of school. So she had to work then for somebody? She worked for the hotel in Alexandria. I know, but I mean in Sweden. Did she work for somebody? No. Why didn't she go to school? I don't know what she did in Sweden. I never remembered what she did. But she stayed home with her father and mother. And was not able to go to school regularly? No, she didn't get no schooling. Her parents, what kind of work were they doing? Just lived on a little piece of land. That's all. Enough so they could get something to eat. And your father, no? I don't know anything about him. No, we didn't keep track of him at all. He never said anything where he came from? I don't remember anything. Because I'm way down in the bottom of the bunch. So they met in Ehrlich and they got married? No, they met on the boat. They met on the boat, yes. But then they continued the friendship in Ehrlich. Yeah, they did. Cut down the logs and built a little home in the woods. Who married them? The Lutherans? I don't know who married them. Evidently it was, because they were Lutherans, both of them. Then he got a homestead? Yeah. He got a 160 acres homestead. And they worked that? In the family? No. She sold it to some Catholic family when she moved to Minneapolis. She couldn't care for it anymore. So your father died then? Oh yeah, he died in 1905. You hardly remember your father then? No, I don't. Hardly. I remember the funeral, that's about all. Because he was in the hospital for two years before he died in Fergus. What happened? Well, he had Breit's disease. I see. And it was slowly deteriorating his health. So he was in the hospital for two years before he passed away. So when he died, was the farm clear then? Oh yes, it was clear. They had to rub away all the brushes? Oh yeah, the boys took care of it. So they were much older than you then? Yeah, they were older than me, except one. How many cows did you have? Oh boy, we had about 14 cows to milk. So there was a good piece of land then? Oh yes, we had good pasture and a lot of grain and corn. Oh yeah, potatoes. We had everything on the farm. Went to the woods and picked berries. Mother had about 300 quarts of berries canned in her basement when the fall came. What kind of berries was that? Raspberries and strawberries and June berries and lingonberries and everything. We had everything. She never bought anything to can. And then you started butchering the hog in the fall? Oh yeah, we had our own meat and calves and beef and pig. Oh yeah, we had our own. Did they put it on in salt? Oh yeah, we cured it. Mother had a smokehouse. We had to go to the woods and get this juniper and put it on the fire so it got a good flavor. It was important, you got to have it with you. And she didn't remarry then after he died? No, no, no. So your father then left with two other children that died when they were small. But there were still nine left. Yep, eleven of us. And they were all home then when your father died? Yep, they were all home. Him was about nineteen only, seventeen or eighteen, nineteen when he took over the farm. He was the oldest of the boys. So he became the one that was the boss? Yep. So, well you were the youngest also, maybe you were spoiled a little bit. Next to the youngest. You didn't have to work as hard as the older ones? Oh yeah, no I didn't, but we had to work hard though. Even outside with the milking? Yes, milk cows and pick potatoes and beans. Oh yeah, we worked, made our own potato flour, grated the potatoes, dried them. Oh yeah, we worked hard for everything we had. Did you raise potatoes to sell? Oh yes. My brother, my younger brother, picked potatoes for a neighbor because he had a hundred acres of potatoes. Just potatoes? Yeah, he got three cents a bushel for picking them. He didn't get rich, but he was thankful for what he got. So were you off from school then in the fall? Yeah, we couldn't go to school when it started. You had to stay home? We had to stay home, we lost out on a lot of schooling. Same in the spring, we had to stay home and herd the cattle where there was no fences. So they got green grass and more milk, you know. Could you graze some other lands too, up in the woods there? No, no, we just stayed on our own. We didn't impose on anybody else. But this hundred sixty acres, there was not open land all of it. When I was little it was. They had a lot of fields and corn and potatoes and beans. Oh yeah, we had it. Were you located close to a lake up there? No, no. You didn't have any small lake? We had a river, Bell River, Bell River, they called it. So you couldn't do any fishing then? Oh yes, they fished in the river. Oh yeah, they brought home tubfuls of fish. So you had plenty of... We had plenty of fish. Mother smoked some of it. Oh yeah, we had plenty to eat all the time. Your mother now going to school only seven days, as you say, in Sweden. Yes, she couldn't write at all. She couldn't? No, she couldn't tell us what to say. I can write Swedish. I can write Swedish. Because she told us what to say and I had to figure out how to spell it. So she wrote letters back to Sweden? Oh yeah, she wrote to her mother and her sister in Borås. So you had to write it and she told you? She told me what to say and I figured it out. How did you learn to write Swedish? Well, we had books, you know, and looked it up. But the Sunday school, did you learn Swedish there? Oh yeah, we had Swedish summer school and Sunday school, both. You were confirmed in Swedish? Mm-hmm. So you were able then to pick up? Oh yes, sure. Did she talk Swedish now on the farm? Oh yes. All the time? Yes, she couldn't talk English at all. She couldn't write either, you know, so we had to help her all the time. That was pretty hard, huh? It was hard on her. But when she went to church now with you, was she able to sing along with the... Oh sure, Swedish. She remembered... Oh sure, she could read Swedish. Salmona? Yes, for all they'll... she could read Swedish. Oh. Sure. She could read it and talk it and sing it. Did she understand English? Yeah, she understood it. But she never answered back in English? Not much, no. Not much. But there never was anybody that she needed the English. Everybody was Swedish up there, you know. All the neighbors were Swedish? Yeah. But you have some Swede Finns up there too, or they were in Parkers Prairie? Yeah. It was further north? No, we went to Carlis. Carlis? Mm-hmm. That's between Ehrlich and us. Yes. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So how often did you go to Ehrlich now? Not very often. Only when they had a circus there, then they took us. Circus. Oh, yeah. Drove with the horses. Well, I don't remember. That was a big thing then when the circus came. You bet you it came. That was a big thing. We went a couple times. Drove with the horses 18 miles. 18 miles? Start out early in the morning, about 6 o'clock in the morning, which was cool. Did you make it back then in the second? Oh, yeah. We had to come back in the evening, sure. Sure, we came back in the evening. So what did you do then? You went in to take a cup of coffee or? Oh, yeah, we went. Mother had some lunch with, you know, so we. Oh, she followed along then? Mm-hmm. She was with us. Couldn't go without her, you know. But you were not able to spend too much, though, because it was. We didn't have no money. No, but she had money enough for the gate to get into the circus. That was, we was thankful for that. So you remember that circus? Oh, yes, I remember. Many years later? I still remember it. Was it Buffalo Bill or? No, it was the Ringling Brothers. Ringling Brothers, the big one? Yes, the big one, sure. So they came there with elephants and rats? Oh, yes, sure, everything. All the animals? Mm-hmm. From all corners of the world? Yeah, yeah, they were quite a big thing. Yeah, I remember all of that. It was a big, and the church was not against that, going to the circus? No. No? No. They were not telling you where to go? No, no, there was nothing wrong with it. How about dancing, now, could you do that? Oh, yes, we went to barn dances. But did the pastor allow that? Oh, well, we didn't care. We went anyway. You had to have some fun. We had to have some fun. All the neighbors went, you know. Sure. What kind of music, was it accordion or? Violin and organ. They'd drag an old organ up there, you know, most of the time in the barn dance, upstairs, when it was noon, without any hay. He waxed the floor, and we had a good time. All the young people came from near and far. I see. Yeah. What kind of dances were they then? Square dances. Square dances. No Swedish dances? No. Oh, yeah, they did a little bit of that, too. They had a little bit of Sharish and Polka, and waltz, and two-step, and square dance, you know. Oh, yeah, we had a little bit of everything. And most of the participants, they were Swedes? Yeah. Or Norwegians? No, there were a few that was not Swedes, but they mixed good. They mixed right in with us. So you stayed on the farm then how long? Till I was 19. 19? Mm-hmm. What happened then? Did you move away then from the area? No, I came down here. How did it happen? Did your mother still stay on the farm then? My mother was still on the farm. So, and your oldest brother, he took it over then, too? Oh, my brothers, they, my oldest brother went to St. Paul and worked on coaches for the train. He was a carpenter. Why didn't he stay on the farm? Because he wanted to go out and earn some money. But it was a good farm, though, 14 cows? No. They didn't make a living? Yeah, but he was the oldest and there was other brothers down below and they could take over. And they did? Oh, sure. They took over. That's true with us girls, too. When one left, the other one had to take over. We had to go out and earn money for clothes. And the boys, they went to South Dakota and, or North Dakota, and worked for thrashing machines, you know. They followed it going north? Sure. And they lived in a, in a, in a, something like a trailer here, you know. They lived in that. They come home in the fall when they got through thrashing out there and they were so full of bugs and raw lice, the mother wouldn't let them in the house. She'd put the head in the door and say hello and the mother says, get to the granary. She sent some clean clothes and a tub of water out there and they had to take a bath and she'd put on clean clothes and leave their old clothes out in the granary because they were full of bugs. So they'd been living together up in those bug houses? Oh, sure. Yeah, sure. Mobile homes or what they called them. Sure, yeah. And they never, they didn't clean themselves too good then up there? No. They just, they had a cook tent and, or cook cab or, what do you call a cook? Well, they had a tent, you know. So they had a cook with them, then they followed the... Yeah, they got good food. They had to work hard, get up at six o'clock in the morning, pitch bundles, wait till dark and retire. Slept in the barn, on the hay bough, overnight. But they had to clean themselves when they came in through the... Oh, yes, they had to clean up....their mother's home. My mother wouldn't allow them in the house. No. And then in the wintertime, did they stay home then? Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah. We had a lot of milk cows, so they kept busy. Kept busy, oh. And horses and cows, I mean pigs and chickens and... So they kept hard, but they kept busy. So you were 19 then, you left for... I came down to Rockford. How did that happen? Well, that guy up there, he came up to visit some people that moved from Rockford to... Carl Einar Anderson. Uh-huh. And he came up to visit, that was it. And he met you for the first time then? No, he met me in 1914. For the first time? Uh-huh. Up there? We went together for seven years before we were married. I see, and he worked on the Rockford? He worked at Clark's. And you lived up there then for seven years? Yeah, uh-huh. Why did you wait this long though? Well, my mother needed me at home to do work. I had help. We couldn't leave until mother sold the farm and moved to Minneapolis. And there was no one other kids that wanted to take over the farm? Yeah, the boys took over to begin with, but she sold the farm. She sold the farm to a Catholic family and they took over, and then mother moved to Minneapolis and bought a house. So that's the way it worked. So you came down there after seven years steady going together, but far away? You didn't see each other then for twice a year? Oh yeah, twice a year or so. Did he take the car then and walk you down? No, no, he'd come on the train. He went to Canada one year and then he stopped by Ann. He worked for a farmer in Canada for one summer. What's that, Lake Louise up there in Canada? Yeah, he was up there for one year. So 1919, when did you marry then? 1919. 1919. October the 9th. And you married down here in Rockford? Who married you, what pastor? Dr. Salmonson. At First Lutheran? No, Zion. Zion? Zion Lutheran. He was up there in Minnesota, so I knew him beforehand, so that's why I wanted to go to him. So did your brothers and sister come down into Rockford here or did you marry her? No. You were all alone? I was all alone, still am. And your husband, he was born in Rockford? Oh yeah. So he had his family? He was born on the farm. Outside? Yeah. In the valley or? Out by Argyle, no not Argyle, still Monroe Center. Monroe Center. So his family was here then? Yeah. So you met them? Well they were up in Minnesota a couple, three times too, so I met them before. So your mother then, she knew then what kind of family you were marrying? Oh yeah, they knew it. Did she tell you anything about dating boys that you should be careful of? No. There were only Swedes out there. Yeah. No, she didn't tell us anything. She tried to keep us home all the time, that's the worst of it. We wanted to go to dances and she didn't like that. She was against that? Oh yeah, she didn't like that at all. But didn't she understand though that you had to go out and meet people and get married so you couldn't move away? Well, she thought it was a sin to go to dances, and it was I guess, to a certain extent. But I suppose the older generation saw more of that. Oh yeah, they were down on that. But us young people, we'd walk miles for to go to the dance. The horses worked in the fields during the day, we couldn't take them at night and go anywhere. You were not allowed to take the horses? No, we walked most of the time. They were supposed to rest? Yeah. So you came down here and then, did you buy a horse then when you married? No, we just rented. Right in Rockford? Uh-huh, on 11th Street and 7th Avenue. And what was he working with now, calling it? Tin can, Clark's Tin Cans. Tin cans, I see. He was a... He's a set-up man. A tool dye maker or a machinist? No, just a machinist. And then he quit there and went to the lock company, worked there for 17 years. And then he retired, so he was retired, so we have a cottage up at Lake Whitewater. We still have that. So we spent a lot of time up at Whitewater. And then, now I turned it over to my son, so he's living in the cottage. So during this time now, you became a member of Rockford Templar's Lodge? Yeah, I did. Was he already a member? No, he wasn't. We didn't like it. But you were members of it over a while. Yeah, I know we were, but he never liked it. I have company, honey. Sophie? Yeah? I got my glasses. How about... He was involved with the Cooperativa. Cooperative, mm-hmm. Was he one of the organizers of it? No. No, he didn't organize that. But he was active in it. Yes, he was. Did he take care of the store? No. We just bought our groceries through them and anything else we needed, we got through them. But he was not on the board and helping out? I think he was for a while, if I remember right. I think he was for a while. And they had two stores in Rockford, didn't they? Or was he only one? Let's see now, did they? I don't remember. Skooksburg, no. He said there was, I think he said there was two. Yeah, maybe it was. So it was not during that time he was a butcher? No, no, no, he was a butcher before that. I see. Before he started at National. Yeah. He was a butcher and he helped out Friday nights and Saturdays down the Bueller Brothers. Well, there was like an extra job. Yeah, and he's a good meat cutter, so... How did he learn that? Through Francine, Bernard Francine. He got in touch with him and Francine asked Einer to come and work for him and he just gradually learned the trade. And we made sausage. Two years ago we were out at Selman Valley with my granddaughter and made sausage. We bought a whole pig. And we made sausage and I tell you we could sell a hundred pounds of that if we had it, but everybody wants our sausage now, but we are not making it anymore. So there was a special blend of... You bet it was. That was Francine's brand. You bet, he knew how to make it. Did you mix potatoes in that one or only... Green, green. No potatoes? No. Potatoes make it black. No, we just use barley grit. And we could have sold 200, 300 pounds of it if we'd have had it, but we kept it amongst the family, you know. I got a granddaughter in Monroe Center and one in Freeport and one in Californian. And then the one in Selman Valley, so they all took part. Are they interested to keep it going? Oh sure. Yeah, you bet. They got the recipe. So they know how to make it then? Oh sure, they know how to make it. We had a machine, we borrowed a machine from the neighbor, put in and stood up about that high and about this big around, just filled that and turned the crown and it came out into the casings. It was very simple. But we spent the whole day doing it. It takes some doing before it's... Oh yes, mixing it and getting everything ready and time and... You know a little bit about it, don't you? Yeah. And there is a special touch you got to do. You bet. Oh, we could have sold a thousand pounds of it if we'd have had it, but everybody wanted sausage. So Polish and Italian sausage are not close to it? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, not at all. This is Swedish. So who... that was Francine's recipe? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Bernard Francine. And he was from Sweden? Yeah, he was from Sweden. Did he have a... He had a butcher shop on Broadway. But your husband, he didn't continue with it more than off and on? No, he just helped out. So he was a machinist and a tool... Yeah, a toolmaker, yeah. Toolmaker, yeah. So you didn't participate in the temperance movement? Not much. I never cared much about it. They weren't our type of people and they weren't church members or nothing. Oh, you belonged to a church too? You bet I did. Zion? No, Salem. Oh, Salem. The Sandler church. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Did you know him? No, but I know who he was. Yeah, yeah. So did you belong to Vasa, Viking, or Switzerland or... No other organization. How did you get your hospitalization insurance now? They usually joined Vasa and Switzerland to get the... State insurance? No, hospitalization for if you got sick. Oh, that's a government job. That's a government project. Yeah, but not at that time. Nobody had insurance. They had to join one of those organizations. Oh, yeah, we had... Velaetra Verbundet and Viking and Switzerland. No, we had insurance. Oh, you had your own then? Yes, we did. Private one? He had it through the factory. Oh, I see. Yeah. So you were all set then. Yeah, he had it through the factory and I did too. So we got along all right that way. So you rented a place then during the 20s? We built on 16th Avenue and 8th Street. What year was that? 1925. Oh, before the Depression. Uh-huh. So what happened then? Well, you came right into the... Well, we pulled through. It was hard for many people. Oh, yes, it was hard, but we made it. I made it. I went out and worked clean for some ladies and took in washings and made a little extra one way or the other. And he went and worked for Butchers, you know, and so we made it. So you were able to make the payments? Yeah, yeah. And my son was a paper boy and he bought his own clothes and we got along. So both your girl and the boy were born before 30, yeah? Uh-huh. So they were small then when they were... Yeah. My boy was born in 1922 and the girl was born in 1926. They're four years apart. But they were hard years though in the 30s there when you... Huh? They were hard years though in the 30s. Oh, yeah, they were hard years. You bet they were. Didn't spend any extra, I tell you. No. But you didn't belong to any organization during that time then? No, not then. Just the church? Yeah, just the church. Were you active in the church? Yeah. I belonged to everything there, but it didn't cost much those days. Not like it does now. Oh. Of course, Benander, he had his own house and kept his own expenses. He didn't ask for any help. No? No, he didn't. He was good that way. We got along all right. But during this time though, there were a lot of people coming from Sweden in the late 20s. They had trouble, you know. Oh, I... Didn't know the language. I guess so. No job. Yeah, that's right. Do you remember some of those that had a job? Well... Or what happened to the girls? Well, they plugged along just like we did, you know. They couldn't talk, some of them, very well, but they'd soon learn. Did they come together and help each other in the group? Oh, yes, they did. Anyone needed help, they helped the other fellow. Oh, yeah. Sure, they were very neighborly. We had a good neighborhood. Your husband was a musician, wasn't he? Mm-hmm, he's a violin player. Did he play at the dances? Yeah, he did some. Mm-hmm. Swedish dances, then? Yeah, and my son was a piano player. He's got a player piano in his house, and he'll have to sell it now, and he's going to move to Arizona. So he's retired now? Yeah, he's retired now. He's 64. He went to high school? Oh, yeah. And college, too? No, no college. How about your girl? No, she just went to high school, that's all. She married when she was quite young, so she didn't go to any college. Did she marry a Swedish... No, no. His name was Hugh Johnson. But he's a... Yeah. This is side two, continuation with Hulda Anderson, Rockford, Illinois. Side two. So was it easy for your children to get a job when they were out of high school? Yes, it was. What kind of work did your boy... Well, when he got out of high school, he got a job as an apprentice toolmaker, and he's been a toolmaker ever since. So he followed in his father's footsteps, then, more or less. Yeah. He worked at the lock company. And then your daughter, she... Well, she got married when she was young, so... So she didn't start to work then? No, she didn't do much work. She's working now at Gates Rubber Company. You see the calendar there. She's an accountant there. I see. And she's making good money, and she won $1,000 the other day. She had a ticket and a trip to Denver at the same time. So now they're going to take a trip to Denver. She came into luck. Yeah, she sure did. Well, she makes good money, though. So it was easier for them than it was for you? Oh, boy, you aren't kidding. It was easy. Do they remember the hard times, though? No, they don't talk about it. No? Uh-uh. They probably wouldn't believe you if you tell them all. Maybe not. I don't know. I haven't said much. But I turned over and gave Roger, my son, the cottage for nothing, not as much as a penny. Up in Wisconsin? Yeah, above Whitewater. What did your daughter say then? I gave her $10,000 in place of it. But my son says she got the best deal. I don't know if he did or not. It was not very nice. Well, I know it, but that's what. Well, he enjoys that cottage. I tell you, he don't stay away from there very long. He was probably kidding when he said that. Oh, maybe so. I don't know. Maybe so. I don't know. Did they join any Swedish organizations? No. Were they interested? They don't talk Swedish at all. No? No. So your husband, he was able to talk Swedish? Oh, sure. He could sing it and read it and write it. So it was the same with me. I could do anything. So there were no difficulties to understand then? No, no. Not at all. No, no. But you didn't use Swedish often in... Not now, we don't....when you met people. No. But before, in the old days, you did. Oh, yes. We did. On Sjöndergatan. Yes, on Sjöndergatan. We did it on a Broadway, too. Oh. Yes. Yes, but the kids don't understand much of it. Very little. A few words here and there, you know. They don't want to understand it, I guess. So they are not interested in it? No. How about their kids now, your grandchildren? No, they don't know anything Swedish. And they are not curious, don't know anything about it? No, they don't understand it at all. They don't want to learn it either. So I never talked to them in Swedish anyway, so... Your mother, now, she moved to Minneapolis, you said. Mother-in-law? No, your mother. My mother, yes. She moved to St. Paul or Minneapolis? Minneapolis. And she bought a house there? Yes, she did. After she sold the farm, she bought a house. And she lived there alone then? Yes, she lived there until she died when she was 90... Was it 99, 89? 99 she was. She lived a long time. So she was a healthy... Yes, she was. She died in 1960. What did she say now in the later years? Did she reminisce about old times? Oh yes, she meant many times, many times. She came down to you here in Rockford? Oh yes, she came and visited us quite a bit. Stayed with you? Yes, she stayed the whole summer with me. Why didn't she talk to your children about Sweden or anything like that? They didn't... She never did? No. No, they weren't interested. So she didn't say anything then? No, she didn't bother with it at all. And she was still not able to read and write then at high age? No. She never picked it up? Never picked it up, uh-uh. How could she enjoy an English sermon though when they changed over to English? Oh well, she understood. Did she order a shirt then? Yes, she understood English beautiful. In later years? Mm-hmm, she understood it all. Sure she did. She could read the newspaper and she could read English. Yes, she could read English. You know, when they came from Sweden and built their little stuga, they cut down the trees and built a house, built a little stuga. In Bell River? In Bell River. And just logs inside of the house. Your father built the house? Mm-hmm. Yeah. No roads, much of anything. They had a walk, walk wherever they was going to go. So there was a crew that built the house then with just two rooms or a kitchen? Just one room. One room? One room. No kitchen? No, yeah, they had a kitchen on one end. The lean two or was it in the same? No, it was all in one. Now it's square. And no second floor? No, no, no, no. No stairway. What kind of roof was it, daughter? I don't know. You can't remember that? No, I don't know until she ever said. I don't remember because I was born in the farmhouse. In that house there. In that house, so you don't remember the old one? No, I don't remember the log house at all. No, no. So your father, he built that house too? Yes, he did. He built that house too. There's still some logs laying behind there. That was the first, the log house. Is that house still standing? Yes. It is? There is no special name there in Bell River where you lived? Certain name, something to call the place? No, no, no. It's just District 41. That was all. We went to school, District 41. Country schools, you know, we had a long way to walk. Froze our hands and feet and face and everything when we walked to school. So you remember the cold winters up there? You bet I do. They were different up there than compared to Rockford? Well, not too much, but we didn't have the facilities and the equipment to do with, you know. You have a second floor there. Did you sleep upstairs? Oh, sure. We had two bedrooms up there. One for the boys and one for the girls. Came up through a... Oh, stairway, yeah, sure. It was all the heat you had? No, we just had stove. There was no stove up there? Stove heat, no stove heat, but the pipe went through, you know. Well, there was no stove upstairs? No, no, no. Yeah, well, there was not enough to dress in the morning. You bet it was cold. You bet it was cold. And we got so used to it, we didn't mind. Cold to go to bed, too, you know. Which time was the worst, to go to bed or go up? Go to bed. Well, it was worse than going up in the morning? Yeah, that was worse. The bed was so cold. Oh, yeah, that was... You would think you would get a chill. You never get the red off, though. Oh, no. We got warm after a while. But you slept together a lot? Oh, yeah. We were two of us in each bed. Each bed. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And if I started hearing, there wouldn't be any... See, we were two older sisters and then two of us younger sisters, so they took care of us. We got along fine. I guess it takes a little caring. Yeah. You came down in the morning, but you didn't drink any coffee, though, when you were... You had to go home and fire, go downstairs and fire in the cook stove and cook our coffee. But did you use coffee, though, the children of the rest of the... Oh, no. We had milk. We had our own cows. Oh, no. We had cold milk. Yeah, but when you came down in the morning, though, you couldn't drink any cold milk. No. Well, we... They milked the cows and brought the milk in, and we drank milk. Oh, yeah. But when you came up, though, after a nice sleep up in this cold room, did you have anything warm to drink when you came down in the morning? There was froth. If we had no water in the pail, that was froth. And even the reservoir in the stove was froth. So the only thing you got to wait for, then, was... Fire in the stove. And oatmeal. What did you have for breakfast? Oh, yeah. We had oatmeal and eggs and... Hotcakes and... Yeah, pancakes we had, sure. Oh, yeah. We got along all right. When did you start to drink coffee? How old were you then? Oh, gosh. We drank coffee when we were kids, I guess. I don't remember. You went to school? Oh, yeah. Sure. What kind of drink did you have to school for the lunch, now? Just water. Water? Just... You got in the school and... Water. You didn't carry any drink, then? No. We carried our sandwiches, but no water. What did you have on the sandwiches? Oh, some meat. My mother had plenty of meat. Smoked and... Yeah, we had smoked meat and we had fresh meat she cooked. Oh, yeah. We had good food all the time. We can't complain on that. And you didn't have any hired help to help you. You were all sufficient with your own crew. Our own help. As soon as we were able, we had to start milk the cows. Did you ever milk a cow? Yeah, I know. Did the men do the milking after the women? Us women helped, too. Your brothers didn't milk? No, we helped. We had so many cows, they had to help, you know. And who was... In the barn....the separator? Yes, we had a separator. Separated the milk. The boys had to do that, though? Oh, no. We had to turn it ourselves. Us girls turned the separator. And all the washing of all the different... Washed by hand. By hand, yeah. Until Mother got... Some lady fell and come around with the corrugated rolls. You know. To roll it on? So that we... In a bucket? Yeah, we put the... In a bucket? No, no. Tubs. In the tubs? Uh-huh. So we washed clothes that way towards last. Otherwise, it's to wash by hand and hang it up and freeze it and take it in when it's frozen and hang it by the stove and... Oh, boy. And then everything was ironed? Oh, yes. Everything was ironed. Were you as particular as the city people to iron sheets and... Oh, yes. Yeah, we did. Pillows. Yeah, we did. Mother wanted them ironed in her... It was necessary, though, didn't it? Oh, yeah. It was... They looked better. Oh, yeah. She wanted everything just so... She was very particular. She knew how things were supposed to be and she had them that way. By us kids doing the work. So you were sleeping in a cold room and in a cold bed, but your linen... Yes....was just right. That's right. That's right. You were living in style. Yeah. We were kept clean, too. No monkey business there. You had to take a bath in every week. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No? Oh, no. No facilities for bath. But you had a... Oh, we... Yeah, we did. We did. But it was impossible in the wintertime. Not much in the wintertime. Took a sponge bath, you know, or something. That's about all. Oh, yeah. We lived through it all. And the washing, though, they had to be done in the kitchen, didn't they? Oh, yeah. That was done in the kitchen. All the water brought in. Mm-hmm. Carried in the... Yes. Had a barrel outside that caught rainwater. So we had soft water. For the soap, yeah. Mm-hmm. And what kind of soap, then, were they... Oh, just bar soap. Bar soap. Mm-hmm. No, no. We never heard of it. How about... Do you remember if you had a small blue bag to make the water... Blue? Yeah. Yeah, we had blue. The whitening. Blue, yeah. It was used. Mm-hmm. For all the white wash. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we worked hard on the farm. Pick potatoes and husk corn. We had to stay home from school in the fall to husk corn by hand. Was their worst job than picking potatoes? Oh, yes. It was so cold. Our hands were so frozen. But you didn't have to bend on so much to hold the corn? Oh, yes, we did. Yeah, but there's always a walking height, it looks like. We didn't pick it that way. They cut it and put it in shocks. Oh, for heaven's sake. Yeah, they done double work on that. Oh. Yeah. And my brother, he had that hand planter, you know, planter. And that's a very antique thing. And my nephew's got the thing hanging on his wall in Minneapolis. He's got it still there, the corn planter. Have you ever seen one of them? Yeah. Mm-hmm. They was used. Yeah. They planted it the hard way and harvested the hard way. And it was hauled by hand to them between the rows for weeds? Oh, yes, sure. We had to haul it. We got one penny a row for hauling the weeds. One penny a row. One penny a row. Some of the rows were long. Some of the rows were plenty long, yes, you bet. Went all the way up in Canada, maybe. No. And the milk check come, and the mother says, we can guess what the milk check would be, and if there's anything over what we guessed, what we got. Maybe it was a nickel or a dime or something. Could you, the kids then, could get that? Yeah, maybe it was a nickel or a dime or something. Tickled them to get it. So that was like a lottery? Yeah, sure. Yeah. So there were many small things that made your life bearable. Oh, yeah. How about at the Christmas time now? Did you have a Christmas tree then taken in? Oh, yeah, we had a Christmas tree. It went down the woods and cut it. You didn't have any spruce up there, though? Oh, yes, plenty of them. Oh, yes, lots of them. And we had juniper with the smokehouse. Mother would have us bring home juniper and birch bark. Birch bark. We could never use kerosene in the cook stove or anywhere. We used a lot of birch bark. We used birch bark for firing up, starting a fire. First thing we did in the morning was get down there and get that stove going with birch bark. So you used a lot of birch wood, too, then? Yeah, it was clean wood. And the boys, they chopped the wood. We had a sawmill come over and cut the saws that long. And then they had to chop it up, you know. You know what that is, yeah. Do you remember if they made any brooms of the birch twigs, birch branches? Any what? Brooms. No, we didn't. You don't remember that? No, I don't remember that. No, we bought the brooms. Yeah. And then the Christmas, now do you remember how long, or far ahead of Christmas? Oh, boy, we looked forward, counted the days. But you didn't put the Christmas tree into Elio. No, we couldn't see the Christmas tree until Christmas Eve. My sister went in the room and decorated it, but we couldn't go in there and see it because there was supposed to be a surprise. It was Christmas Eve, that was the first time you saw the Christmas tree? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Yeah. And it was 7, 6, 7, 12? Well, Pudner went to the ceiling, of course. Yeah, we looked forward to that. What kind of ornaments did they dress it with? Not much. We had popcorn, that's about the main thing. No fire eggs or anything like that? No, and candles. No Swedish gifts, you remember they said? No, no, no. How about the Christmas gifts? Did Santa Claus come in? Not much. No Santa Claus? Oh, yeah, he came, but he didn't leave much. Did you see him? No. You never saw Santa Claus? We put a box out on the porch for him to leave us something. And you received that Christmas Eve? Yeah, Christmas Eve, after supper. So how about the Christmas Eve at noontime, doppade i grytan? Oh, yes, yes, we still did that. Three, four, five years ago, we still doppade i grytan. But when you were young, what kind of bread were you using? Was it kaka? Yeah, kaka. Kaka, the modern bagel. Yes, with the rom-pom. Did she have an oven to bake those? Oh, yeah, she had one of them flat boards, you know, that she... What do you call them? Skjøvde? Yeah, yeah. I don't know what you call it, but I forgot. What did you call it? Skjøvle. Skjøvle, oh, skjøvle, ja. Brødspade. Yeah, I guess that's what you call it. Brødspade, ja. Oh, yeah, we baked our own bread. We had a mill nearby in Sprue Center that ground our flour and rye flour and everything. We didn't buy flour at all. We just had our own flour all the time, the real natural thing. And we had our own yeast. We never bought yeast. How did you make that? Well, we had a quart jar that we used half of that and put it in the potato flour at night, and then we used that half a quart of yeast that we had, and then before we put flour in it in the morning, we took out another half a quart and set it in the basement stairway for next time that we baked. That's the way our yeast was. Was it in salt form or...? No, no, in water. It was like water then? Yeah, that was potato water. And then whatever was in it, I don't know. I don't know how they got started with it, but the neighbors all used it. They got them together and got it somewhere. I don't remember that. So you never ran out of yeast then? In other words, you had to continue on? Oh, continued. Made good bread, too. I know my husband came up there and he said, boy, I could eat a ton of that stuff. So there was a different taste then with that kind of yeast? Oh, yes. It was so moist and good, you know. So you took it home, coca? You betcha. Were you able to bake that, too? Oh, yes. You could try it at Agford? I baked some of it, but it wasn't the same because I didn't have no yeast like that. Oh, yeah. So that yeast is all gone out of business now? Oh, I guess so. I don't think they got it anymore. No, I don't think so. I don't think the young people want to bother with it. We couldn't get to town to buy yeast and it didn't keep very good, you know. Oh, yeah. Gone through it. And on Christmas Day you went to Julgruetta? Oh, yes. All ihop, with all of you? Four o'clock in the morning we'd get up and... You walked? No, no. We drove horses. And there was always snow up there? Three miles. Three miles. Do you remember most of the mornings with snow and cold? Sure, with snow and cold. Very cold. But we made it. Come home, we were so glad to get some julgruetta and some sylta and coffee. Hadde de lydsvisk också? Yes, I should say so. De båt en alek? Ja, she bought the dry stuff and fixed it herself, yeah. And watered it out and... Yeah, sure. So she knew all those tricks from Sweden? Yes, I should say so. Did you learn? I did it too, but when I was young I helped with it, but I didn't do it here in town. No, no. We bought it all fixed here, you know. Did you eat it? Yes. How about... you invited the neighbors? Oh, yes. We had a koloss. Koloss all the time. Yeah, we had to speak for a day ahead of time, a whole week ahead of time. We wanted a certain day. We went from one to the other a whole week, probably until the 6th of January. That was about the last. That was Trettener Dom. So you were still standing up then? Oh, yes. When did you throw the ot? Oh, after the 6th of January. Then it went out. Mm-hmm. By then it was so dry we had to do it. Did you have live candles in it? Mm-hmm. That was risky business. But they were lit only on Christmas Eve? Yeah, a little bit. Maybe we had company or something. No, we couldn't light it very often. You don't remember if it was standing in a bucket of water or anything like that? No, we didn't know enough to do that. No? It was in a... Just in a pail of sand, I guess it was, with some braces on it. So your parents didn't have any relation up in Minnesota? No, no. Not at all. Only good friends around? Yeah, a lot of friends, neighbors. So a lot of kids come together then? Yeah, we did. We went together a lot for parties. So when they came, the partygoers, we say, could you children be along then at the table? Oh, no. We had to wait till the old people all had eaten. Then we could eat afterwards. Sure, but we got enough to eat. We got enough to eat. I remember the first time we was over to some people, we got some Jell-O. We had never seen that before. So Mother got so enthused about that Jell-O. So next time we went to town, we got some Jell-O boxes. So they also knew. They was new for us, yeah. How about funerals now? When somebody... Do you remember your father's funeral? You were old enough then, or you don't remember how they did it? How did they announce it at that time? When they had children? No, when somebody died. They announced it in the church, but did they send out letters to... I don't remember that. I guess they had telephone. We had telephone quite early. Was the funeral held at the home? Yeah. In the home? Yes, in our living room. And were they treated for coffee? Oh, it was so cold. They had to drive three miles with the casket and then they come back for coffee afterwards. And there was neighbors and friends? The place was full of people. Yeah, but we couldn't go with to the funeral. We had the funeral pastor at the house, but we couldn't go with to the church. Was it too cold? Too cold. Oh, I see. Too cold. So they had to wait to bury them in the spring there? No, they had the grave dug. They dug the grave with the boys, the men up there in the neighborhood. They dug the grave. At Spruce Hills Cemetery? Yeah, he's still there. My mother's there and my two of my sisters. And your mother's in that same? Yeah, and my two sisters and all my brothers are there, except one, he's in Alexandria. So there's the whole family. How often have you been back now to this? Oh, I used to go back. I used to go back on the bus a couple, three times a day because Mother was. Oh, it's a year you mean? Yeah, a year. Because my mother lived at the Bethany home in Alec. Oh, in Alec, oh yeah. Yeah, you know about that place? Oh, yeah, sure, I've been there. Well, my mother lived there many, many years because she sold a farm and there's where she went to when she, and then she moved to Minneapolis afterwards. After you sold the farm. Yeah. But then she came from Minneapolis to Alec, then to Bethany home. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So there's where she stayed. Mm-hmm, she died there. My sister died there, too, and my brother died there, Brother Walter and Sister Ellen. They both died there, too, and Emil did, too, that's right, two brothers. They all went through that home? Mm-hmm. It's a beautiful home. Were you the only one that left Minnesota? I guess so, yeah, I guess I was the only one. Mother used to come down on the train. To visit you? Yeah, and then the supper went from Oregon, you remember that? Mm-hmm, that was a great train. They took that off, you know, that was too bad. They had that vista dome, you know, and you'd sit up there and see all the beauty of the country. And my husband and I, we took the train up there just for a sightseeing trip. And I had some friends living by the depot in Oregon. They'd get up Sunday morning and do the chores early and get on the train and ride back. And we stayed about five, ten minutes in Minneapolis and rode back again. Just for the sight and scenery in the fall when the trees were all colored, you know. Their name was Mammons. And we went there quite often to Oregon, visited them. So your mother, she saw a lot of different changes then in her life. Oh, yeah, I guess so. From the log cabin to the Zephyr. Yeah, that's right. That's right, you're right. What did she comment about that? Oh, she thought it was great, that Zephyr. She just loved to come down on it. We met her in Oregon, you know. Oh, yeah, she liked to travel. Here in Oregon, Illinois, you mean? Mm-hmm. She went back to Sweden in 19... what year was that? 1910, I guess it was, she went back to Sweden. 1910? She went alone then? No, a fellow by the name of Ericsson, he ran a store up there, and he went back to see his folks. So they took the boat together. But goodness sakes, they had to spend so much time on the boat, you know. So her parents were still living then? Yeah, her mother was. Well, not her father, but her mother and her sister was. And she was the only one that left for America? Mm-hmm. Well, she had a brother, but he disappeared when he got to New York. They didn't hear from him afterwards. I don't know what happened to him. We tried to locate him. We went through all kinds of sources to try to locate him, but we couldn't. We could never find him. His name was Johan Svensson. He disappeared? Yeah. We tried everything. So now you are here at this nursing center. Yeah. I suppose I'll live and die here. So your husband, when did he pass away? Colleen? Gee, when was it? Five, six years ago? Oh, it was longer than that. You know, I'm so forgetful when it comes to dates. He died of a heart attack, just toppled over in the chair. He was at Whitewater Restaurant. It was a terrible shock. That was just awful. How long did you continue to drive your car? Did you drive your car? Yeah, I drove my car. How long did you? About three years ago. Since Roger sold it to a fellow in Oregon. So Roger says, I'm going to go down there someday and see if you still got it. It's a Corvair. Beautiful little car. So you were able to drive it then? Oh yeah. No problem. Yeah, I drove all over grocery store, out to the kids. You didn't go up to Minnesota at all? Not myself, no. But around town you were able to manage the traffic? Oh yeah, I went all over. Yeah, I did. I did. I managed the traffic. A lot of friends in Rockford. You have had pretty good health though over the years. No, I haven't. I have no hip in this side. Oh yeah, from here and up I'm fine. Stomach and lungs? Yeah, no. I've had a lot of operations though. You have? Oh yeah. Gallbladder and appendix and hip operations and tonsils and I don't know what else. You had them all? Yeah, I had them all. But you look pretty good. Oh, I feel fine from here and up. I only wish I could walk. But I can't walk at all without help. Either the walker or the chair here. And that's all right. I get around. How about your mother? She had a tremendous height. Yeah, she didn't walk very good either. She had a bad hip too. Was she quite clear in her head during these last few years? Or was she able to reminisce and remember? Oh yeah, she couldn't walk very good and couldn't get around. She had to have help all the time. But she was coming up to close to 100. Well, she had a big family and went through a lot of sacrifice. She done all right.
